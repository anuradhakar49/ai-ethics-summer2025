# Student Projects ‚Äì AI Ethics and Business Summer Learning Program 2025

This directory documents the hands-on projects developed by student teams during the **Aivancity‚ÄìIIIT-Bangalore Summer Learning Program 2025**.

Each project reflects a critical inquiry into the ethical, social, and cultural dimensions of AI technologies, undertaken through cross-institutional collaboration between students from Aivancity Paris-Cachan and IIIT-Bangalore.

Several mentoring sessions for the hands on projects session were organized during the summer learning program. Finally the students presented their projects on the final day of the program before a jury.

- ## Ethical AI for Student Performance Prediction in Educational Systems

### ML question
* Build and train a n ML model to predict student performance (e.g., final grade or pass/fail status). How accurately can a machine learning model predict student academic performance using socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioral data?

### Ethical Questions:
* Bias and fairness: Does the model disproportionately mispredict for students from underrepresented backgrounds?
*  Data privacy: How is sensitive student data handled responsibly?
*  Algorithmic transparency: Can educators and students understand how predictions are made? Intervention risks:
*  Could predictions lead to harmful labeling or academic tracking?

## üåç Collaborative Learning Approach

Each team consisted of students from both institutions, encouraging:

- Interdisciplinary perspectives bridging ML and ethics
- Peer-to-peer learning across cultures  
- Co-design of solutions rooted in ethical principles
---

## üèÅ Outcomes

Each team delivered:

- A jupyter notebook with the ML task implementation
- A presentation discussing the ML results and ethical questions

These outcomes can be found under this repository.
