# Student Projects ‚Äì AI Ethics and Business Summer Learning Program 2025

This directory documents the hands-on projects developed by student teams during the **Aivancity‚ÄìIIIT-Bangalore Summer Learning Program 2025**.

Each project reflects a critical inquiry into the ethical perspectives of AI technologies, where the students first implement an ML solution followed by answering questions related to the ethical side of the ML problem.

Several mentoring sessions for the hands on projects session were organized during the summer learning program. Finally the students presented their projects on the final day of the program before a jury.

## üß† Project Themes
The hands-on projects addressed real-world challenges at the intersection of AI and ethics, including (but not limited to):

## Project 1:Fair and Sustainable Energy Usage Predictions: An AI and Ethics Case Study
### Group name, members, github link 
*Group: Croissant (Sparsh, Dikshita,Sindhoor) 
*Project github link : https://github.com/sparshagra/PowerConsumptionPredictor

### ML question
Implement binary classification and predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes (Outcome: 0 = No, 1 = Yes).
### Ethical Questions:
* Bias & Fairness:Does the model perform differently across gender, age, or ethnicity? What are the implications of such disparities?
* Privacy: What data would a real-world version of this system collect? How can we ensure patient confidentiality?
* Transparency: Is the model‚Äôs decision understandable to a non-technical healthcare worker? Should patients be informed how an AI judged their risk?
* Responsibility: Who is accountable if the model gives a wrong diagnosis? Should AI be used as a decision support or a decision maker?

## Project 2: ML based Cow Calving Ease prediction with ML and its ethical perspectives
### Group name, members, github link
*Group: PSG
*Project github link : https://github.com/maverickk-ux/CowMonitoringSystem

### ML question
Implement an ML model to predict energy consumption at a future time point (e.g., hourly/daily usage) or categorize usage patterns (e.g., high, medium, low).
### Ethical Questions:
* Bias in access: How might AI models favor certain socio-economic groups or regions?
* Privacy concerns: What are the risks of using granular energy data for prediction?
* Transparency and accountability: How to explain AI decisions in a fair, interpretable way?
* Sustainability: Can AI help detect energy inefficiencies or recommend eco-friendly practices without penalizing vulnerable groups?

## Project 3: Investigating Bias and Transparency in AI-Powered Credit Scoring
### Group name, members, github link
*Group: Baguette Bunch
*Project github link : https://github.com/sahiti3636/finance_project_aivancity.git
### ML question
Implement an ML model for binary classification and predict whether an individual should be granted a loan (Yes/No).

### Ethical Questions:
* Bias and Discrimination: Are predictions fair across gender, age, or ethnicity?
* Transparency: Can model decisions be explained clearly?
* Autonomy and Consent: Do users know how their data is used?
* Accountability: Who is responsible when AI denies credit unfairly?
  
## Project 4: Ethical AI for Student Performance Prediction in Educational Systems
### Group name, members, github link
*Group: Les Astucieux: Varun, Adithya, Shivansh, Tejas
*Project github link : https://github.com/Varun-iiitb/pass-fail-predictor.git
  
### ML question:
* Build and train a n ML model to predict student performance (e.g., final grade or pass/fail status). How accurately can a machine learning model predict student academic performance using socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioral data?

### Ethical Questions:
* Bias and fairness: Does the model disproportionately mispredict for students from underrepresented backgrounds?
*  Data privacy: How is sensitive student data handled responsibly?
*  Algorithmic transparency: Can educators and students understand how predictions are made? Intervention risks:
*  Could predictions lead to harmful labeling or academic tracking?

## üèÅ Outcomes

Each team delivered:

- A jupyter notebook with the ML task implementation
- A presentation discussing the ML results and ethical questions

These outcomes can be found under this repository, named as Project_1_report, Project_1_notebook etc
