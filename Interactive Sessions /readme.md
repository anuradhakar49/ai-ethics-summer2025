## ❓ General Questions

<details>
<summaryIf an AI system replaces human decision-making (e.g., in hiring or medical triage), what ethical considerations must be addressed??</summary>

We must ensure that there is no bias both in the data and the training. 

Example - company using AI recruitment tool may prefer candidates based on their race, gender, which should be avoided. also as the employment rates of males employees were higher in the past, the new decisions must not be based on them (biased and supporting men).

Also there might be cases in which a person is lying in their CV. It is easily detectible by a person but might not be easy for an AI system. So there might be problems arising due to that. 

Also we must ensure that AI does not take a decision which might put the life of other people in danger. There must be human intervention in making such decisions. 

If the AI approves a drug which might put the lives of a lot of people to risk, human intervention ensures such a thing doesn't happen.
