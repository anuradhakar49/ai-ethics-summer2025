## ‚ùì General Questions

1. ### If an AI system replaces human decision-making (e.g., in hiring or medical triage), what ethical considerations must be addressed??

* We must ensure that there is no bias both in the data and the training. 
Example - company using AI recruitment tool may prefer candidates based on their race, gender, which should be avoided. also as the employment rates of males employees were higher in the past, the new decisions must not be based on them (biased and supporting men).
* Also there might be cases in which a person is lying in their CV. It is easily detectible by a person but might not be easy for an AI system. So there might be problems arising due to that. 
* Also we must ensure that AI does not take a decision which might put the life of other people in danger. There must be human intervention in making such decisions. 
* If the AI approves a drug which might put the lives of a lot of people to risk, human intervention ensures such a thing doesn't happen. 

2. ### If an AI system replaces human decision-making (e.g., in hiring or medical triage), what ethical considerations must be addressed?
* Assuming AI system replaces human decision making the main goal would be to be unbiased and fair. In hiring, there should be no prejudices, discrimination based on nationality, gender or age. It should solely be based on your experience, qualifications and education. It should also make sure that no re enforcement learning as it can cause bias towards a particular group of people
