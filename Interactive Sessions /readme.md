## üìå Objective: 

This repository contains a curated list of questions which were designed to evaluate students‚Äô understanding of ethical theories and principles, and their ability to apply them to real-world tech issues (2-3 minutes each). The answers are given by different student groups participating in the learning experience.

## ‚ùì Interactive questions bridging AI and Ethics

1. ### If an AI system replaces human decision-making (e.g., in hiring or medical triage), what ethical considerations must be addressed?
* We must ensure that there is no bias both in the data and the training. Example - company using AI recruitment tool may prefer candidates based on their race, gender, which should be avoided. also as the employment rates of males employees were higher in the past, the new decisions must not be based on them (biased and supporting men).Also there might be cases in which a person is lying in their CV. It is easily detectible by a person but might not be easy for an AI system. So there might be problems arising due to that. Also we must ensure that AI does not take a decision which might put the life of other people in danger. There must be human intervention in making such decisions.  If the AI approves a drug which might put the lives of a lot of people to risk, human intervention ensures such a thing doesn't happen. 

2. ### If an AI system replaces human decision-making (e.g., in hiring or medical triage), what ethical considerations must be addressed?
* Assuming AI system replaces human decision making the main goal would be to be unbiased and fair. In hiring, there should be no prejudices, discrimination based on nationality, gender or age. It should solely be based on your experience, qualifications and education. It should also make sure that no re enforcement learning as it can cause bias towards a particular group of people

3. ### Should users have ownership of their personal data? What ethical principles support your answer?
* Users should definitely have the ownership of their personal data as it is a fundamental right of a person to control their own data i.e autonomy 
Even the EU AI guidelines specify general data protection regulation (GDPR) that only a minimal/required amount of data should be taken from the user as the users are the owners of their data. The companies therefore should also be accountable for the persons from whom they have collected the data. So the users can put forward their consent for which purposes their data can be used. Keeping this in mind the company should be transparent while using the users‚Äô data.

4. ### What ethical issues arise when companies collect user data without explicit awareness?
* Some of the ethical issues which arise are the violation people's right to privacy and data protection are fundamental rights which must be respected at all times.  This is one few reasons why the people are still skeptical about including ai in every day needs. The data which was collected must not be used in training any models and it must be discarded once the query is answered. if the company wants to collect any data it must make sure the customer is aware before using the ai. The user should always know where there data is going and what it is being used for.

5. ### What ethical questions can arise out of the use of AI in surveillance systems?
* AI might also do racial bias while making judgment of animalities. For example a person is accused without any reason because he belongs to a certain race as in the dataset, the thefts were performed in high amount by that race. So questions might arise on fairness. Also there might be privacy risks. For example, our data, what we are doing also get stored under normal surveillance systems but AI systems can easily detect our daily lifestyles and then use these data for their profit to feed major companies which is ethically very wrong. In case of critical errors, it is hard to hold an entity responsible. So who is responsible? All crimes must be testified in court and witnesses have to be under oath when speaking in the court, but as AI is not a human being it cannot be under oath, So we can't use it for judgment. 

6. ### What are your opinions regarding releasing a flawed but potentially life-saving AI model?
* Since it is a flawed model, it will be very unethical to release such an AI model which can harm the lives of people due to incorrect outputs.
So the company should first work on the model to reduce the flaws as much as possible by working on the dataset and making it robust as it is still a life saving model.What the company can do is work with the doctors and figure out how much the AI is deviating from the doctor‚Äôs analysis.
An example for this can be if we have an AI model which detects beginning stages of cancer and if it gives a +ve results for a person without cancer, this can be very harmful. Another option is to take consent of small groups of people and test the model on them as real life testing is very essential for these kinds of models , and then take feedback from them to improve the model and make it fit for release on the large scale.

7. ### What ethical issues arise when companies collect user data without explicit awareness?
* User data retrieval in the most difficult part of project management. There is no transparency, and clear directions about where the data is coming from. There are certain limits which the AI companies must abide by before training their models. And data privacy is definitely the top priority. I think data encryption can help in  preserving the privacy and preventing data leaks.
